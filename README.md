# Multi-Tenant AI Operations Assistant

This repository hosts the implementation for a multi-tenant AI Operations Assistant that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), intent classification, and agentic tool execution. The goal is to provide tenant-isolated knowledge retrieval alongside actionable workflows (e.g., task management) while maintaining observability and guardrails.

## Status

- Initial scaffolding
- Backend and frontend components to be integrated in subsequent feature branches

## Repository Layout

- backend/ — FastAPI-based services, ingestion, retrieval, and agent orchestration (TBD)
- frontend/ — Next.js interface for chat, tooling, and administration (TBD)
- Makefile — Common project commands (setup, lint, test, etc.)

Additional design documentation and setup instructions will follow as the implementation progresses.
