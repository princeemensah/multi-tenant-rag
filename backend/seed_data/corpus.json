It outlines the shared vocabulary for severity levels and references the unified severity matrix used by every tenant to decide escalation paths. The zero downtime maintenance window is reiterated because regional carriers rely on it for compliance audits.\n\nPhase one focuses on triage. Shift leads verify telemetry gaps, cross-check the observability dashboards, and initiate the lattice alert for incident commanders. Within fifteen minutes the command channel must brief the partner retailers, emphasizing shipment protection steps and alternative routing guidance.\n\nPhase two coordinates recovery. Robotics handlers move critical pallets to safe zones, while the platform team deploys the service rollback bundles. Documented dependencies on third-party fulfillment gateways highlight where the multi-tenant isolation guardrails prevent cross-tenant data leakage during recovery."
